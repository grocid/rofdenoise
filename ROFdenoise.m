%  Description:
%
%  This denoising method is based on total-variation, originally proposed by
%  Rudin, Osher and Fatemi. In this particular case fixed point iteration
%  is utilized.
%
%  For the included image, a fairly good result is obtained by using a
%  theta value around 12-16. A possible addition would be to analyze the
%  residual with an entropy function and add back areas that have a lower
%  entropy, i.e. there are some correlation between the surrounding pixels.
